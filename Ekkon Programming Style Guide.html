	<h1>Ekkon Programming Style Guide</h1>
	<i>Note that this style guide is not a complete reference. It builds upon ideas that are seen as common practice, listing only the styles that Ekkon has changed. Refer to the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">Google C++ style guide</a> for any missing rules. Questions may be forwarded to <a href="mailto:bobbyewy@gmail.com">bobbyewy@gmail.com</a>.</i>

	<h2>Documentation</h2>
	Every header file must have its own comment header at the top. This must be above <pre style="display:inline"><code>#include</code></pre>s and other compiler directives.
	A header should be layed out as follows:

<pre><code>/*
 * Class: Rectangle
 * Author: John Doe
 * Date: 01/05/2016
 * Description: A simple header-only class for rectangles. More
                sample text to demonstrate newlines.
 */</code></pre>

	Dates must be in the form <pre style="display:inline"><code>DD/MM/YYYY</code></pre>. Headers must be added to files at the time of creation to ensure completeness of the comment header.

	<h2>Files and File Structure</h2>
	Every source file must have one header file to match. Header files must contain one and only one class.
	Source files may not declare classes; they must implement class functions as follows:

<pre><code>void Rectangle:operate() {

}</code></pre>

	Every header file must have the <pre style="display:inline"><code>#pragma once</code></pre> directive immediately below its comment header, only preceded by a single blank line. <b>Do not use header guards!</b> They are an old convention left over from compilers that did not provide similar directives.

<pre><code>/*
 * ...
 */

#pragma once

// Do not do this.
#ifndef CLASSNAME_HEADER_GUARD
#define CLASSNAME_HEADER_GUARD
...
#endif</code></pre>

	<h2>Functions</h2>
	Always indent function bodies properly. Braces should be <b>on the same line</b> as the function.

<pre><code>void operate() {
}

// Do not do this.
void operate()
{
}</code></pre>

	If a function has no parameters, do not specify void.
<pre><code>// Do not do this.
void operate(void);</code></pre>

	When declaring funtions in header files, name the parameters.
<pre><code>// Do not do this.
void operate(int, float);</code></pre>

	<h2>Pointers and References</h2>
	Pointers must be declared as follows:

<pre><code>int* pointer1;</code></pre>

	Pointer dereferences must have no space between the * and variable name. Obtaining a pointer must also be done in similar fashion.

<pre><code>int value1 = *pointer1;
int* pointer2 = &value1;</code></pre>

	References must be formatted in the same way.
	
<pre><code>int& value2 = value1;</code></pre>
